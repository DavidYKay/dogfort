# Dog Fort

![Dog Fort](https://raw.github.com/bodil/dogfort/master/dogfort.jpg)

A rudimentary web server framework for ClojureScript on Node.js,
inspired by [Ring](https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring).

This is *experimental code*. If you build anything on this right now,
you're being stupid.

# Red Lobster

A toolkit for working asynchronously on Node in ClojureScript, which
sits at the heart of Dog Fort. Wraps Node's `EventEmitter` and
`Stream` types, and provides some useful abstractions; in particular,
promises.
